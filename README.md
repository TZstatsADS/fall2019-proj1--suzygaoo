### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Song Lyrics Data Story
+ This project is conducted by Suzy Gao

+ Project summary: We all love music and singers, and we may have our favorite playlist that we listen to every day. With the continuous development of technology, we have the opportunity to explore different types of music more and easier. Some of us like Pop music, some like country music, and some enjoy EDM more. Music is everywhere and has become an indispensable part of our life. People love different songs due to different reasons. We can fall in love with a song because of its melody, or sometimes we feel like the lyrics resonate with us so well. It's very interesting to study people's music preferences and the reason behind. Let's take a look at the secret of songs -- the lyrics! And find out the patterns of different types of song lyrics!
